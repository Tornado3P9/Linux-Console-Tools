# An old collection of notes and scripts.

This is a reupload of an earlier directory to my primary GitHub account.  
I have excluded the Macromedia Flash 8 content from 2011, which, while enjoyable, is not relevant to this Linux directory.  
I do not plan to organize or update many of these notes or scripts, as this is a personal collection intended for my own use.
You will also notice that I typically leave various versions and solutions in the code across all my repositories, serving as a reminder for me when I revisit them later.
However, others might find it useful nevertheless, so feel free to look around. If you intend to use the code for your own projects, it may be advisable to tidy it up beforehand.
