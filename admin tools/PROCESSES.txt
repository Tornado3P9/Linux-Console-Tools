    ##########################
     
    # listing all signals
    kill -l
     
    # sending a signal (default SIGTERM - 15) to a process by pid 
    kill pid        # => Ex: kill 12547
     
    # sending a signal to more processes
    kill -SIGNAL pid1 pid2 pid3 ...
     
    # sending a specific signal (SIGHUP - 2) to a process by pid
    kill -2 pid
    kill -HUP pid
    kill -SIGHUP pid
     
    # sending a signal (default SIGTERM - 15) to process by process name
    pkill process_name          # => Ex: pkill sleep
    killall process_name
    kill $(pidof process_name)  # => Ex: kill -HUP $(pidof sshd)
     
    # running a process in the background
    command &   # => Ex: sleep 100 &
     
    # Showing running jobs
    jobs
     
    # Stopping (pausing) the running process
    Ctrl + Z
     
    # resuming and bringing to the foreground a process by job_d
    fg %job_id
     
    # resuming in the background a process by job_d
    bg %job_id
     
    # starting a process immune to SIGHUP
    nohup command &     # => Ex: nohup wget http://site.com &
