    # running top in batch mode (3 refreshes, 1 second delay) and save the whole thing to a text file
    top -d 1 -n 3 -b > top_processes.txt

    # looking for changes of 'docker' between the three iterations in the just generated text file
    grep docker top_processes.txt


    ## finding the description for the MEMORY-fields:
    man top
    # Now just highlight 'DESCRIPTIONS of Fields' in the OVERVIEW Table of Contents and press the Middle_Mouse_Button
    # On Linux based systems this has got the same effect like 'STRG+C, STRG+V'. Ofcourse you can just type it.
    /DESCRIPTIONS of Fields
    # Afterwards use 'n' for going forward and 'N' for going backward
    # After typing 'n' once you should arrive at the chapter concerning memory
