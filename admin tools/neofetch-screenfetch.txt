## Terminal tool for fetching system information and displaying them in a pretty way

[screenFetch](https://github.com/KittyKatt/screenFetch) is a command-line system information tool.
```bash
sudo apt install screenfetch
```

[Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) is a command-line system information tool written in bash 3.2+, but it is not being maintained anymore.
```bash
sudo apt install neofetch
```

[Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) is faster than neofetch (it's written in c), it is more feature-rich and it's being actively maintained.  
Either download a precompiled package from the github webpage or compile the source code yourself.
