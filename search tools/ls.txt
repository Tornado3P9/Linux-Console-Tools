ls -1v
-l = Auflistung
-A = Alles zeigen, bis auf "." oder ".."
-h = For Humans understandable.
-1 = One file per line
-X = Sorted by extension
-t = Ordered by time
-S = Ordered by size
-r = reverse order
-v = sorted by (version) numbers within text
-F = show file type by appending indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries, also try 'file /run/*' to display some file types
--full-time = displays full time stamp
-d = about the Directory
-i = inode number
-R = list subdirectories recursively (ls -lR => aehnlicher Effekt, wie bei 'tree')
-I = Ignore some files (ls -I "*.txt")

### Get File Size: K, M, G, KB, MB, GB
# This will give you a long format listing (needed to actually see the file size) and round file sizes up to the nearest MiB
ls -l --block-size=M filename
# If you want MB (10^6 bytes) rather than MiB (2^20 bytes) units, use --block-size=MB instead.
ls -l --block-size=MB filename
# --block-size=M cause a M suffix to be displayed next to the size, and you can use --block-size=1M to omit it
ls -l --block-size=1M filename
# If you simply want file sizes in "reasonable" units, rather than specifically megabytes, then you can use -lh to get a long format listing and human readable file size presentation
ls -lh filename
# Show all files in the directory with a human readable format
ls -lh

dir (auch bei Windows)

Standard Alias:
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias l='ls -CF'

Therefore "l -l" would be the same as "ls -CFl" (often used for more detailed output)

To get the newest file or directory, use this command:

ls -t | head -1

To get the oldest file or directory, use this command:

ls -t | tail -1



Further examples:

ls -l -t | head -3

Will give you top 3 lines (2 files and the total).

This will just give you the first 2 lines of files, skipping the size line:

ls -l -t | tail -n +2 | head -2

tail strips the first line, then head outputs the next 2 lines.

ls -l /bin/firefox
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 25 Sep  4 17:09 /bin/firefox -> ../lib/firefox/firefox.sh

See the permissions and other information about the /etc directory:
ls -ld /etc
  drwxr-xr-x 154 root root 12288 Sep 12 19:24 /etc




Selection examples using sed, just for variety:

ls -l | sed -n 2p

Using this alternative, which looks more efficient since it stops reading the input when the required line is printed, may generate a SIGPIPE in the feeding process, which may in turn generate an unwanted error message:

ls -l | sed -n -e '2{p;q}'

I've seen that often enough that I usually use the first (which is easier to type, anyway), though ls is not a command that complains when it gets SIGPIPE.

For a range of lines:

ls -l | sed -n 2,4p

For several ranges of lines:

ls -l | sed -n -e 2,4p -e 20,30p
ls -l | sed -n -e '2,4p;20,30p'
