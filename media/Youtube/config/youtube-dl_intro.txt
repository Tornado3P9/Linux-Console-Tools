#CONFIGURATION#

You can configure youtube-dl by placing any supported command line option to a configuration file.
On Linux and macOS, the system wide configuration file is located at /etc/youtube-dl.conf and the user wide configuration file at ~/.config/youtube-dl/config.
On Windows, the user wide configuration file locations are %APPDATA%\youtube-dl\config.txt or C:\Users\<user name>\youtube-dl.conf.
Note that by default configuration file may not exist so you may need to create it yourself.

For example, with the following configuration file youtube-dl will always extract the audio, not copy the mtime,
use a proxy and save all videos under Movies directory in your home directory:

# Lines starting with # are comments

# Always extract audio
-x

# Do not copy the mtime
--no-mtime

# Use this proxy
--proxy 127.0.0.1:3128

# Save all videos under Movies directory in your home directory
-o ~/Movies/%(title)s.%(ext)s

Note that options in configuration file are just the same options aka switches used in regular command line calls thus there must be no whitespace after - or --,
e.g. -o or --proxy but not - o or -- proxy.

You can use --ignore-config if you want to disable the configuration file for a particular youtube-dl run.

You can also use --config-location if you want to use custom configuration file for a particular youtube-dl run.


#LOGIN/ MARK VIDEO AS WATCHED#

You can tell mpv to pass on options to youtube-dl by using the --ytdl-raw-options flag. See "man mpv" in terminal for examples.
I think I got it working though still need to figure out the best way to do it.
Sending the parameters to youtube-dl to mark something as watched is easy -> -u username -p password --mark-watched
the problem is that for some reason I was getting a 500 error when trying to send the 2FA code and it kept erroring out.
Still, being asked for 2FA every time I want to watched a video is crap so tried using an app specific password...
only to find out that youtube-dl mimics a browser on the background and app passwords don't work on browsers xD.

What I end up doing was using the extension cookies.txt for chrome to get my youtube cookie
and now I pass that to youtube-dl this way -> --cookie=/path/to/cookie --mark-watched and works perfectly.
What I'm gonna do now is put that in the config file and make mpv pass that to youtube-dl every time it gets executed.
