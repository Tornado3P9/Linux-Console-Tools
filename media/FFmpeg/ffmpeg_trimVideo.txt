ffmpeg -ss 00:01:00 -i input.mp4 -to 00:02:00 -c copy output.mp4

This command trims your video in seconds!

Explanation of the command:

      -i: This specifies the input file. In that case, it is (input.mp4).
     -ss: Used with -i, this seeks in the input file (input.mp4) to position.
00:01:00: This is the time your trimmed video will start with.
     -to: This specifies duration from start (00:01:40) to end (00:02:12).
00:02:00: This is the time your trimmed video will end with.
 -c copy: This is an option to trim via stream copy. (NB: Very fast)

The timing format is: hh:mm:ss
